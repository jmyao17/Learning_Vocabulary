# python4kids
Welcome to python4kids course! This repository collects all the materials for the course.
We will upload lecture notes and codes ahead of the course so that the students can either run or editor the code during and after the lecture.

In this course, we are using the online platform: repl.it: https://repl.it/
I appreciate if students can sign up your own account on the website before the lecture.
You are also not neeeded to be concerned if you have no idea to do it.
We will go through it during the lecture anyway.

Hope we will spend a happy coding time together in the coming week.

Looking forward to meeting you soon.
